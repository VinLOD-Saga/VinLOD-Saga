                <p>
                    This document was created for the Text Encoding and Semantic Representation exam, which required the production of an XML/TEI-encoded version of a selected text. The project focuses on the anime and manga <hi rend="italic">Vinland Saga</hi>, approached through the lens of ten artifacts from Norse tradition, chosen for their thematic and symbolic relevance.
                    In order to conceptually connect these ten items—including a recording of Wagner’s <hi rend="italic">Ride of the <orgName ref="#VK">Valkyries</orgName></hi>—a literary reference to <placeName ref="#VH">Valhalla</placeName> and the <orgName ref="#VK">Valkyries</orgName> was sought. The <hi rend="italic">Poetic Edda</hi> was identified as the ideal source, being the most significant collection of mythological and heroic Old Norse poetry. More specifically, the <hi rend="italic">Grímnismál</hi> ("Sayings of Grímnir") was selected, a poem that explicitly references both <placeName ref="#VH">Valhalla</placeName> and the <orgName ref="#VK">Valkyries</orgName>, and is remarkable for its dense catalog of names—of beings, deities, and places, both real and imagined.
                    Given that the poem is presented as direct speech, the <gi>sp</gi> element with the <att>who</att> attribute was used to mark speakers. As the text is not transcribed from a facsimile and no images were available, the textual features were described in as much detail as possible. This included the use of <gi>q</gi> for quotations, <gi>hi</gi> with <att>rend</att> for stylistic emphasis, <gi>said</gi> for marking direct and indirect speech, and <gi>emph</gi> for emphasis. Regarding the latter, although the entire poem is inherently emphatic due to its epic nature, <gi>emph</gi> was used selectively to reflect interpretative choices and draw attention to particularly significant passages.
                    In the <gi>profileDesc</gi>, a list of the languages, people, places, and organizations referenced in the text was included. Since two characters share the same name, they were explicitly distinguished, thanks also to the use of <gi>listRelations</gi>. As for the language, the translation used is modern and does not represent authentic Old Norse. Although the archaizing style is deliberately crafted to evoke a sense of antiquity, the entire text has been encoded using the ISO code for Modern English. The <gi>distinct</gi> element was not used, as it would not have been entirely appropriate: the language itself is not truly ancient, and ISO standards do not distinguish between stylistic variants such as archaic versus contemporary English.
                    Due to the presence of 53 unique proper names (excluding repetitions) and 33 distinct places, only those characters currently on stage were annotated. Among them, <persName ref="#OT">Odin</persName> proved the most complex: he is associated with around fifty epithets, many of which are self-declared during the poem (<ref>cf. stanza 48:</ref> <quote source="#s48-3"><q>A single name | have I never had</q></quote>). These were encoded using the <att>epithet</att> attribute. The <orgName ref="#VK">Valkyries</orgName>, in contrast, are only mentioned and do not actively appear; for this reason, they were referenced as a collective entity within a <gi>listOrg</gi> element, in line with the project’s focus on their symbolic function rather than on individual names. The Valkyrie names were not listed in <gi>particDesc</gi> for the same reason.
                    Only notes directly related to <placeName ref="#VH">Valhall</placeName> and the <orgName ref="#VK">Valkyries</orgName> were included, as these were central to the aims of the project. <emph>These references were also annotated for use in RDF, in order to link them to the other entities within our conceptual map.</emph> Additional notes—although potentially informative for a general editorial context—were often redundant or irrelevant for encoding purposes, and mostly repeated content discussed during the course. Moreover, the editor of the source text provided minimal commentary on manuscript variation, mentioning only minor naming differences in the introduction. Consequently, a <gi>listWit</gi> was not included, as there were no significant textual variants to record.
                    This text was subsequently transformed into HTML for presentation purposes (names and people were preserved in HTML to make them clickable and linkable to dedicated web pages for further exploration), using XSL for the layout. The transformation from XML to HTML was performed in Python. Additionally, selected portions of the <gi>teiHeader</gi> were extracted and converted into RDF: among these, as already mentioned, the <orgName ref="#VK">Valkyries</orgName> and <placeName ref="#VH">Valhalla</placeName>, as well as parts of the <gi>fileDesc</gi>, to conceptually connect the XML object to the other items selected for the project.

The <gi>body</gi> consists of a primary <gi>div</gi> enclosing the entire content, followed by a series of nested <gi>div</gi> elements. These include the two introductory paragraphs to the narrative (numbered as described above), the ballad itself, and a final section marked as the ending with the appropriate attribute. For the ballad, orthographic segmentation has been applied using the <gi>l</gi> element to mark individual lines and the <gi>lg</gi> element to group them into stanzas. Each <gi>l</gi> is numbered sequentially within its parent <gi>lg</gi>. The <gi>back</gi> contains the footnotes. In the source text, these were organized by stanza, so when necessary they have been grouped using the <gi>noteGrp</gi> element. Each <gi>note</gi> is linked to its corresponding <gi>l</gi> element within the relevant stanza to maintain clarity and accurate referencing thourghout the use of <att>target</att>.</p>

                    This document was produced as part of the Text Encoding and Semantic Representation examination, which required creating an XML/TEI-encoded version of a chosen text. To conceptually link ten selected items—more specifically a recording of Wagner’s <hi rend="italic">Ride of the <orgName ref="#VK">Valkyries</orgName></hi>—a literary reference to <placeName ref="#VH">Valhalla</placeName> and the <orgName ref="#VK">Valkyries</orgName> was deliberately sought. The Poetic Edda was identified as the ideal source, being the most significant collection of mythological and heroic poetry in Old Norse tradition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <hi>Poetic Edda</hi> is the modern designation for a collection of anonymous Old Norse narrative poems written in alliterative verse. Separate from the related Prose Edda, it remains a cornerstone for the study of Old Norse literature. Among its various versions, the most significant is the medieval Icelandic manuscript known as the <hi><foreign xml:lang="la">Codex Regius</foreign></hi>, which preserves 31 poems. These poems mainly adopt the fornyrðislag (“old story metre”), alongside the málaháttr (“speech form”), with about a quarter composed in ljóðaháttr (“song form”). Their language tends to be direct and unembellished, making use of kennings that are generally simpler and less intricate than those in skaldic poetry. Originally transmitted orally by poets and minstrels across generations, the poems lack named authors, though many reveal distinct stylistic traits that hint at individual creative voices. Despite scholarly efforts to identify possible authors, no definitive attribution has ever been established — leaving the Poetic Edda as a powerful testament to the shared and anonymous artistry of medieval Nordic tradition.
                </p>
                <p> The chosen text specifically focuses on <hi>Grímnismál</hi> (“The Sayings of <persName ref="#OT">Grimnir</persName>”), a poem remarkable for its dense catalogue of names—of deities, beings, and places, both real and mythical—and its explicit references to <placeName ref="#VH">Valhalla</placeName> and the <orgName ref="#VK">Valkyries</orgName> Preserved in the <hi><foreign xml:lang="la">Codex Regius</foreign></hi> and the fragmentary AM 748 I 4to manuscript, it is spoken in the voice of Grímnir, one of <persName ref="#OT">Odin</persName>’s many guises—a name itself meaning “hooded” or “masked.” The narrative recounts how King Geirröth, by mistake, tortured <persName ref="#OT">Odin</persName> in this disguise, ultimately bringing about his own death. Composed mostly in ljóðaháttr, Grímnismál is characteristic of wisdom poetry. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The text presented here is an excerpt from the English translation by <persName ref="#HAB">Henry Adam Bellows</persName>—a newspaper editor and early commissioner of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission—published as part of the “Scandinavian Classics” series for the American-Scandinavian Foundation, an institution dedicated to cultural exchange between the United States and Northern Europe. This translation was later transcribed and released as an eBook by Project Gutenberg, which served as the primary source for this work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The XML transcription aimed to be as faithful as possible, retaining special characters, text structure, page layout, and the original use of italics. All words and letters were transcribed verbatim without normalization, since the text had already been modernized from Old Norse to an archaizing form of English by the translator. Spacing was standardized to single spaces. Entities physically present in the narrative were annotated, while others merely mentioned were generally excluded—except for references essential to the project’s RDF graph construction, specifically <placeName ref="#VH">Valhalla</placeName> and the <orgName ref="#VK">Valkyries</orgName>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Within the poem, orthographic segmentation was applied, marking individual lines and stanzas, each sequentially numbered. All punctuation from the source text has been preserved. Hyphenation at line breaks was not altered.
                    Only annotations directly relevant to <placeName ref="#VH">Valhalla</placeName> and the <orgName ref="#VK">Valkyries</orgName> were included, as they aligned with the conceptual aims of the project. Additional editorial notes, largely redundant, were omitted. The translator provided little commentary on manuscript variation; consequently, no witness list was included, as there were no significant variants to document. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Names and epithets of the characters on stage (except where they referred to the <orgName ref="#VK">Valkyries</orgName>) — especially those connected to <persName ref="#OT">Odin</persName>, who alone is attributed with around fifty epithets, many of which appear in stanza 48 — were encoded through dedicated attributes. As the <orgName ref="#VK">Valkyries</orgName> are mentioned but never directly appear in the narrative, they were encoded collectively to highlight their symbolic role rather than as individual figures. Proper names were retained in HTML to remain clickable and linkable to dedicated pages, while the layout was generated with XSL and the XML-to-HTML transformation carried out in Python.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What is especially compelling about <persName ref="#HAB">Bellows</persName>’ translation is his deliberate choice of archaic English: an attempt to echo the cadence and distant resonance of Old Norse, reviving its solemnity for modern readers. Through careful encoding and thoughtful interpretation, this edition seeks to preserve not only the text itself, but the spirit that still breathes through its ancient lines.

                        <p>Like the preceding poem, the <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="non">Grimnismol</foreign></hi> is largely encyclopædic in nature, and consists chiefly
                            of proper names, the last forty-seven stanzas containing no less than two hundred and twenty-five 
                            of these. It is not, however, in dialogue form. As Müllenhoff pointed out, there is underneath the 
                            catalogue of mythological names a consecutive and thoroughly dramatic story. <persName ref="#OT">Othin</persName>, concealed 
                            under the name of <persName ref="#OT">Grimnir</persName>, is through an error tortured by <persName ref="#GR">King Geirröth</persName>. Bound between two 
                            blazing fires, he begins to display his wisdom for the benefit of the king’s little son, Agnar, who 
                            has been kind to him. Gradually he works up to the great final moment, when he declares his true 
                            name, or rather names, to the terrified <persName ref="#GR">Geirröth</persName>, and the latter falls on his sword and is killed.

                        </div>
                    <div type="paragraph" n="3"> 
                        <p>For much of this story we do not have to depend on guesswork, for in both manuscripts the poem 
                            itself is preceded by a prose narrative of considerable length, and concluded by a brief prose 
                            statement of the manner of <persName ref="#GR">Geirröth</persName>’s death. These prose notes, of which there are many in the 
                            Eddic manuscripts, are of considerable interest to the student of early literary forms. Presumably 
                            they were written by the compiler to whom we owe the Eddic collection, who felt that the poems needed 
                            such annotation in order to be clear. Linguistic evidence shows that they were written in 
                            the twelfth or thirteenth century, for they preserve none of the older word-forms which help us to date 
                            many of the poems two or three hundred years earlier.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div type="paragraph" n="4"> 
                        <p>Without discussing in detail the problems suggested by these prose passages, it is worth noting, 
                            first, that the Eddic poems contain relatively few stanzas of truly narrative verse; and second, that 
                            all of them are based on narratives which must have been more or less familiar to the hearers 
                            of the poems. In other words, the poems seldom aimed to tell stories, although most of them 
                            followed a narrative sequence of ideas. The stories themselves appear to have lived in oral prose 
                            tradition, just as in the case of the sagas; and the prose notes of the manuscripts, in so far as they 
                            contain material not simply drawn from the poems themselves, are relics of this tradition. The 
                            early Norse poets rarely conceived verse as a suitable means for direct story-telling, and in some 
                            of the poems even the simplest action is told in prose <q rend="dq">links</q> between dialogue stanzas.

                        <p>The applications of this fact, which has been too often overlooked, are almost limitless, for it 
                            suggests a still unwritten chapter in the history of ballad poetry and the so-called <q rend="dq">popular</q> epic. 
                            It implies that narrative among early peoples may frequently have had a period of prose existence 
                            before it was made into verse, and thus puts, for example, a long series of transitional stages 
                            before such a poem as the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi>. In any case, the prose notes accompanying the Eddic poems 
                            prove that in addition to the poems themselves there existed in the twelfth century a considerable 
                            amount of narrative tradition, presumably in prose form, on which these notes were based by the compiler.

                            stanzas have undoubtedly crept in from other poems, but the beginning and end of the poem are 
                            clearly marked, and presumably it has come down to us with the same essential outline it had 
                            when it was composed, probably in the first half of the tenth century.

                            <p><persName ref="#HT">Hrauthung</persName> had two sons: one was called Agnar, and the other <persName ref="#GR">Geirröth</persName>. 
                                Agnar was ten winters old, and <persName ref="#GR">Geirröth</persName> eight. Once they both rowed in a boat 
                                with their fishing-gear to catch little fish; and the wind drove them out into the 
                                sea. In the darkness of the night they were wrecked on the shore; and going up, 
                                they found a poor peasant, with whom they stayed through the winter. The 
                                housewife took care of Agnar, and the peasant cared for <persName ref="#GR">Geirröth</persName>, and taught 
                                him wisdom. In the spring the peasant gave him a boat; and when the couple 
                                led them to the shore, the peasant spoke secretly with <persName ref="#GR">Geirröth</persName>. They had a fair 
                                wind, and came to their father’s landing-place. <persName ref="#GR">Geirröth</persName> was forward in the 
                                boat; he leaped up on land, but pushed out the boat and said, <said aloud="true"> <q rend="dq">Go thou now 
                                where evil may have thee!</q></said> The boat drifted out to sea. <persName ref="#GR">Geirröth</persName>, however, 
                                went up to the house, and was well received, but his father was dead. Then 
                                <persName ref="#GR">Geirröth</persName> was made king, and became a renowned man.

                            <p><persName ref="#OT">Othin</persName> and <persName ref="#FR">Frigg</persName> sat in Hlithskjolf and looked over all the worlds. <persName ref="#OT">Othin</persName> said:

                                they made a wager about this matter. <persName ref="#FR">Frigg</persName> sent her maid-servant, <persName ref="#FU">Fulla</persName>, to

                                fierce as to leap at him. Now it was a very great slander that <persName ref="#GR">King Geirröth</persName> was 
                                not hospitable; but nevertheless he had them take the man whom the dogs would not attack. He wore a dark-blue mantle and <said aloud="false">called himself 
                                <persName ref="#OT">Grimnir</persName></said>, but said no more about himself, though he was questioned. The king had him 
                                tortured to make him speak, and set him between two fires, and he sat there 
                                eight nights.<persName ref="#GR">King Geirröth</persName> had a son ten winters old, and called <persName ref="#AG2">Agnar</persName> after his

                                and said that <said aloud="false">the king did ill in letting him be tormented without cause.</said> <persName ref="#OT">Grimnir</persName> 
                                drank from the horn; the fire had come so near that the mantle burned on
