                <p>
                    This document was created for the Text Encoding and Semantic Representation exam, which required the production of an XML/TEI-encoded version of a selected text. The project focuses on the anime and manga <hi rend="italic">Vinland Saga</hi>, approached through the lens of ten artifacts from Norse tradition, chosen for their thematic and symbolic relevance.
                    In order to conceptually connect these ten items—including a recording of Wagner’s <hi rend="italic">Ride of the <orgName ref="#VK">Valkyries</orgName></hi>—a literary reference to <placeName ref="#VH">Valhalla</placeName> and the <orgName ref="#VK">Valkyries</orgName> was sought. The <hi rend="italic">Poetic Edda</hi> was identified as the ideal source, being the most significant collection of mythological and heroic Old Norse poetry. More specifically, the <hi rend="italic">Grímnismál</hi> ("Sayings of Grímnir") was selected, a poem that explicitly references both <placeName ref="#VH">Valhalla</placeName> and the <orgName ref="#VK">Valkyries</orgName>, and is remarkable for its dense catalog of names—of beings, deities, and places, both real and imagined.
                    Given that the poem is presented as direct speech, the <gi>sp</gi> element with the <att>who</att> attribute was used to mark speakers. As the text is not transcribed from a facsimile and no images were available, the textual features were described in as much detail as possible. This included the use of <gi>q</gi> for quotations, <gi>hi</gi> with <att>rend</att> for stylistic emphasis, <gi>said</gi> for marking direct and indirect speech, and <gi>emph</gi> for emphasis. Regarding the latter, although the entire poem is inherently emphatic due to its epic nature, <gi>emph</gi> was used selectively to reflect interpretative choices and draw attention to particularly significant passages.
                    In the <gi>profileDesc</gi>, a list of the languages, people, places, and organizations referenced in the text was included. Since two characters share the same name, they were explicitly distinguished, thanks also to the use of <gi>listRelations</gi>. As for the language, the translation used is modern and does not represent authentic Old Norse. Although the archaizing style is deliberately crafted to evoke a sense of antiquity, the entire text has been encoded using the ISO code for Modern English. The <gi>distinct</gi> element was not used, as it would not have been entirely appropriate: the language itself is not truly ancient, and ISO standards do not distinguish between stylistic variants such as archaic versus contemporary English.
                    Due to the presence of 53 unique proper names (excluding repetitions) and 33 distinct places, only those characters currently on stage were annotated. Among them, <persName ref="#OT">Odin</persName> proved the most complex: he is associated with around fifty epithets, many of which are self-declared during the poem (<ref>cf. stanza 48:</ref> <quote source="#s48-3"><q>A single name | have I never had</q></quote>). These were encoded using the <att>epithet</att> attribute. The <orgName ref="#VK">Valkyries</orgName>, in contrast, are only mentioned and do not actively appear; for this reason, they were referenced as a collective entity within a <gi>listOrg</gi> element, in line with the project’s focus on their symbolic function rather than on individual names. The Valkyrie names were not listed in <gi>particDesc</gi> for the same reason.
                    Only notes directly related to <placeName ref="#VH">Valhall</placeName> and the <orgName ref="#VK">Valkyries</orgName> were included, as these were central to the aims of the project. Additional notes—although potentially informative for a general editorial context—were often redundant or irrelevant for encoding purposes, and mostly repeated content discussed during the course. Moreover, the editor of the source text provided minimal commentary on manuscript variation, mentioning only minor naming differences in the introduction. Consequently, a <gi>listWit</gi> was not included, as there were no significant textual variants to record.

                        <p>The text has been structured into three main sections: <gi>front</gi>, <gi>body</gi>, and <gi>back</gi>. The <gi>front</gi> contains the title divided into a <gi>title</gi> element indicating the main title, and another indicating the subtitle—along with the author's introductory note, encoded as two paragraphs within <gi>div</gi> elements that are individually numbered with <att>n</att>. The <gi>body</gi> consists of a primary <gi>div</gi> enclosing the entire content, followed by a series of nested <gi>div</gi> elements. These include the two introductory paragraphs to the narrative (numbered as described above), the ballad itself, and a final section marked as the ending with the appropriate attribute. For the ballad, orthographic segmentation has been applied using the <gi>l</gi> element to mark individual lines and the <gi>lg</gi> element to group them into stanzas. Each <gi>l</gi> is numbered sequentially within its parent <gi>lg</gi>. The <gi>back</gi> contains the footnotes. In the source text, these were organized by stanza, so when necessary they have been grouped using the <gi>noteGrp</gi> element. Each <gi>note</gi> is linked to its corresponding <gi>l</gi> element within the relevant stanza to maintain clarity and accurate referencing thourghout the use of <att>target</att>.</p>

                        <p>Like the preceding poem, the <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="non">Grimnismol</foreign></hi> is largely encyclopædic in nature, and consists chiefly
                            of proper names, the last forty-seven stanzas containing no less than two hundred and twenty-five 
                            of these. It is not, however, in dialogue form. As Müllenhoff pointed out, there is underneath the 
                            catalogue of mythological names a consecutive and thoroughly dramatic story. <persName ref="#OT">Othin</persName>, concealed 
                            under the name of <persName ref="#OT">Grimnir</persName>, is through an error tortured by <persName ref="#GR">King Geirröth</persName>. Bound between two 
                            blazing fires, he begins to display his wisdom for the benefit of the king’s little son, Agnar, who 
                            has been kind to him. Gradually he works up to the great final moment, when he declares his true 
                            name, or rather names, to the terrified <persName ref="#GR">Geirröth</persName>, and the latter falls on his sword and is killed.

                        </div>
                    <div type="paragraph" n="3"> 
                        <p>For much of this story we do not have to depend on guesswork, for in both manuscripts the poem 
                            itself is preceded by a prose narrative of considerable length, and concluded by a brief prose 
                            statement of the manner of <persName ref="#GR">Geirröth</persName>’s death. These prose notes, of which there are many in the 
                            Eddic manuscripts, are of considerable interest to the student of early literary forms. Presumably 
                            they were written by the compiler to whom we owe the Eddic collection, who felt that the poems needed 
                            such annotation in order to be clear. Linguistic evidence shows that they were written in 
                            the twelfth or thirteenth century, for they preserve none of the older word-forms which help us to date 
                            many of the poems two or three hundred years earlier.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div type="paragraph" n="4"> 
                        <p>Without discussing in detail the problems suggested by these prose passages, it is worth noting, 
                            first, that the Eddic poems contain relatively few stanzas of truly narrative verse; and second, that 
                            all of them are based on narratives which must have been more or less familiar to the hearers 
                            of the poems. In other words, the poems seldom aimed to tell stories, although most of them 
                            followed a narrative sequence of ideas. The stories themselves appear to have lived in oral prose 
                            tradition, just as in the case of the sagas; and the prose notes of the manuscripts, in so far as they 
                            contain material not simply drawn from the poems themselves, are relics of this tradition. The 
                            early Norse poets rarely conceived verse as a suitable means for direct story-telling, and in some 
                            of the poems even the simplest action is told in prose <q rend="dq">links</q> between dialogue stanzas.

                        <p>The applications of this fact, which has been too often overlooked, are almost limitless, for it 
                            suggests a still unwritten chapter in the history of ballad poetry and the so-called <q rend="dq">popular</q> epic. 
                            It implies that narrative among early peoples may frequently have had a period of prose existence 
                            before it was made into verse, and thus puts, for example, a long series of transitional stages 
                            before such a poem as the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi>. In any case, the prose notes accompanying the Eddic poems 
                            prove that in addition to the poems themselves there existed in the twelfth century a considerable 
                            amount of narrative tradition, presumably in prose form, on which these notes were based by the compiler.

                            stanzas have undoubtedly crept in from other poems, but the beginning and end of the poem are 
                            clearly marked, and presumably it has come down to us with the same essential outline it had 
                            when it was composed, probably in the first half of the tenth century.

                                sea. In the darkness of the night they were wrecked on the shore; and going up, 
                                they found a poor peasant, with whom they stayed through the winter. The 
                                housewife took care of Agnar, and the peasant cared for <persName ref="#GR">Geirröth</persName>, and taught

                                led them to the shore, the peasant spoke secretly with <persName ref="#GR">Geirröth</persName>. They had a fair

                                went up to the house, and was well received, but his father was dead. Then
